# NOTE - this script been stripped down to take care of 
#            F90 modules only
#
# This script does makefiles for individual object targets.  However, 
# it only includes dependencies for F90 modules
#
# It initializes itself by defining the target half of each 
# dependency line, then printing a special first dependency 
# line containing target's object file, subroutine name, makefile 
# name, a colon, and the source file on which the others are 
# dependent.
#
# Example of first dependency line: 
# CLM.o ObjDepends/CLM.do: CLM.f
#
# Example of other dependency line: 
# CLM.o: io.o
#
# Predefined variables     Typical values
#     NAME                    CLM
#     SUF                      .f
#     COMPDIR                  ./compile
